                This web-map is part of a long-term project of the Carolina Cartography Collective to create geovisualizations and other resources related to environmental, social, and political issues in Vieques, Puerto Rico. Vieques was occupied by the U.S. Navy between 1940 and 2001, during which time it was used for bomb testing, ground-warfare, and amphibuous training exercises.
                <br><br>
                In 1978, a group of community organizers from Vieques, along with the Puerto Rican Governor Carlos Romero-Barcel√≥, filed a lawsuit against the Navy for the impact it was having on the ecology of the island and its roughly 10,000 residents. The case was heard in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, appealed, heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First District, appealed again, and finally heard in the Supreme Court in 1982.
                <br><br>
                The case ultimately came down to determining what kind of power the Clean Water Act gave courts to stop people (or institutions, like the Navy) from violating the Act. There are lots of complexities to it, but essentially they decided that the court could not issue an injunction (i.e. order the violator to stop their activity immediately) unless it posed a significant and immediate threat to human health and well-being, or there was no other legal way to get them to eventually stop.
                <br><br>
                Since then, the case has been cited hundreds of times in many different kinds of cases. This map was created by extracted information from the cases that have cited Weinberg v. Romero-Barcelo and adding location data to them based on where the case was heard. The resulting information is displayed here.
                <br><br>
                Tools used to do all of this include Lexis Nexis, R, GitHub, and Leaflet (and the associated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). Eventually, this web-map will be accompanied by a step-by-step guide to how the data used to make this map was created, because it could be useful for others interested in doing research related to legal history and environmental justice.<i>Weinber v.
