Case Summary




Procedural Posture
Petitioners, government officials, sought certiorari review of the order of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit vacating the district court's order denying respondents, officials and residents of Puerto Rico, an injunction, under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C.S. § 1251 et seq., to prevent petitioners from discharging pollutants into navigable waters.
Overview
Respondents, officials and residents of Puerto Rico, brought an action against petitioners, government officials, under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C.S. § 1251 et seq., to stop the discharge of ordnance into the waters surrounding Puerto Rico. The district court found that respondents had violated the FWPCA by discharging the ordnance without a permit and ordered respondents to obtain a permit. The district court denied injunctive relief. The circuit court vacated the district court's order, with instructions to issue injunctive relief. The court reversed the circuit court's order. At the outset, the court ruled that the circuit court erred in concluding that the district court was without authority to provide relief short of an injunction. The statutory scheme of the FWPCA, including a phased compliance scheme, and limitations on injunctions, suggested that the district had discretion in addressing violations. Moreover, the court ruled that in the present case, where the discharge was not found to have polluted the waters, the violation could be resolved by the less restrictive remedy of requiring petitioners to secure the proper permit.
Outcome
The court reversed the circuit court's order vacating the district court's order denying respondents, officials and residents of Puerto Rico, an injunction because the district court had authority to issue an appropriate remedy that was less restrictive than an injunction. The court remanded for further proceedings.

Under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C.S. § 1251 et seq., the discharge of any pollutant requires a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. 33 U.S.C.S, §§ 1311(a), 1323(a). The term "discharge of any pollutant" is defined as any addition of any pollutant to the waters of the contiguous zone or the ocean from any point source other than a vessel or other floating craft. 33 U.S.C.S. § 1362(12). "Pollutant," in turn, means dredged spoil, solid waste, incinerator residue, sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, chemical wastes, biological materials, radioactive materials, heat, wrecked or discarded equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt and industrial, municipal, and agricultural waste discharged into water. 33 U.S.C.S. § 1362(6).

HN5[]  Injunctions, Grounds for Injunctions
An injunction is an equitable remedy. It is not a remedy which issues as of course, or to restrain an act the injurious consequences of which are merely trifling. An injunction should issue only where the intervention of a court of equity is essential in order effectually to protect property rights against injuries otherwise irremediable. The basis for injunctive relief in the federal courts has always been irreparable injury and the inadequacy of legal remedies.

HN6[]  Injunctions, Grounds for Injunctions
Where plaintiff and defendant present competing claims of injury, the traditional function of equity has been to arrive at a nice adjustment and reconciliation between the competing claims. In such cases, the court balances the conveniences of the parties and possible injuries to them according as they may be affected by the granting or withholding of the injunction. The essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power of the chancellor to do equity and to mould each decree to the necessities of the particular case. Flexibility rather than rigidity has distinguished it.

HN7[]  Equity, Irreparable Injury
The award of an interlocutory injunction by courts of equity has never been regarded as strictly a matter of right, even though irreparable injury may otherwise result to the plaintiff, and where an injunction is asked which will adversely affect a public interest for whose impairment, even temporarily, an injunction bond cannot compensate, the court may in the public interest withhold relief until a final determination of the rights of the parties, though the postponement may be burdensome to the plaintiff. The grant of jurisdiction to ensure compliance with a statute hardly suggests an absolute duty to do so under any and all circumstances, and a federal judge sitting as chancellor is not mechanically obligated to grant an injunction for every violation of law.

The comprehensiveness of equitable jurisdiction is not to be denied or limited in the absence of a clear and valid legislative command. Unless a statute in so many words, or by a necessary and inescapable inference, restricts the court's jurisdiction in equity, the full scope of that jurisdiction is to be recognized and applied. The great principles of equity, securing complete justice, should not be yielded to light inferences, or doubtful construction.

HN9[]  Clean Water Act, Water Quality Standards
Under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), it is unlawful for any person to discharge a pollutant without obtaining a permit and complying with its terms. An NPDES permit serves to transform generally applicable effluent limitations and other standards, including those based on water quality, into the obligations (including a timetable for compliance) of the individual discharger, and the amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C.S. § 1251 et seq., provide for direct administrative and judicial enforcement of permits. With few exceptions, for enforcement purposes a discharger in compliance with the terms and conditions of an NPDES permit is deemed to be in compliance with those sections of the amendments on which the permit conditions are based. In short, the permit defines, and facilitates compliance with, and enforcement of, a preponderance of a discharger's obligations under the amendments.

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C.S. § 1364(a), directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to seek an injunction to restrain immediately discharges of pollutants he finds to be presenting an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons or to the welfare of persons. This rule of immediate cessation, however, is limited to the indicated class of violations. For other kinds of violations, the FWPCA authorizes the Administrator of the EPA to commence a civil action for appropriate relief, including a permanent or temporary injunction, for any violation for which he is authorized to issue a compliance order.

Rather than requiring a district court to issue an injunction for any and all statutory violations, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C.S. § 1251 et seq., permits the district court to order that relief it considers necessary to secure prompt compliance with the FWPCA.

Decision
Federal District Court relief of violations of permit requirements of Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 USCS 1251 et seq.), held not limited to immediate cessation orders.  
Summary
A number of persons, including the Governor of Puerto Rico and residents of the island, filed an action against the United States Navy in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico to enjoin the Navy's use of an island off the Puerto Rico coast for weapons training, alleging violations of numerous federal environmental statutes and various other laws, including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 USCS 125] et seq.). The District Court found that, under the explicit terms of the Act, the Navy had violated the Act by discharging ordnance into the water surrounding the island without first obtaining a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit from the Environmental Protection Agency, and the District Court ordered the Navy to apply for a permit, but refused to enjoin Navy operations pending consideration of the permit application, concluding that an injunction was not necessary to ensure suitably prompt compliance by the Navy (478 F Supp 646). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit vacated the District Court's order and remanded with instructions that the court order the Navy to cease the violation until it obtained a permit, concluding that the District erred in undertaking a traditional balancing of the parties' competing interests and that the Navy had an absolute statutory obligation to stop any discharges of pollutant until the permit procedure had been followed and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency had granted a permit (643 F2d 835).
On certiorari, the United States Supreme Court reversed and remanded. In an opinion by White, J., joined by Burger, Ch. J., and Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, Powell, Rehnquist, and O'Connor, JJ., it was held that the Federal Water Pollution Control Act does not require a Federal District Court to enjoin immediately all discharges that do not comply with the Act's permit requirements, but rather permits a District Court to order that relief it considers necessary to secure prompt compliance with the Act, such relief including, but not being limited to, an order of immediate cessation.
Powell, J., concurring, expressed the view that the record clearly established that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to enjoin the immediate cessation of all discharges and would remand the case to the Court of Appeals with instructions that the decision of the District Court should be affirmed.
Stevens, J., dissenting, expressed the view that while injunctions should not issue automatically or mechanically in every case an unpermitted discharge of a pollutant that occurs, Congress, by enacting the 1972 amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, circumscribed the District Courts' discretion on the question of remedies so narrowly that a general rule of immediate cessation must be applied in all but a narrow category of cases, and that the instant case did not present the kind of exceptional situation that justified a departure from the general rule.

  ERROR §1400  > scope of review -- discretion of Federal District Court to issue immediate cessation order --  > Headnote: LEdHN[7][] [7]
In a case in which a Federal District Court ordered the United States Navy to apply for a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit after finding that the Navy had violated the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 USCS 1251 et seq.) by discharging ordnance into waters surrounding an island without first obtaining a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency, but refused to enjoin Navy operations pending consideration of the permit application, the proper standard for appellate review is whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying an immediate cessation order while the Navy applied for a permit, Congress, in enacting the Act, having not foreclosed the exercise of equitable discretion.  
Syllabus




 The Navy, in the course of using an island off the Puerto Rico coast for air-to-ground weapons training, has discharged ordnance into the waters surrounding the island, when pilots missed land targets and accidentally bombed the waters or intentionally bombed water targets. Respondents sued in Federal District Court to enjoin the Navy's operations, alleging violation of, inter alia, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA).  The District Court, while finding that the discharges have not harmed the quality of the water, held that the Navy had violated the FWPCA by discharging ordnance into the waters without first obtaining a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency, and ordered the Navy to apply for a permit but refused to enjoin the operations pending consideration of the permit application.  The Court of Appeals vacated and remanded with instructions to order the Navy to cease the violation until it obtained a permit, holding that the FWPCA withdrew the District Court's equitable discretion to order relief other than an immediate prohibitory [****2]  injunction.
Held: The FWPCA does not foreclose completely the exercise of a district court's discretion, but, rather than requiring the court to issue an injunction for any and all statutory violations, permits the court to order relief it considers necessary to secure prompt compliance with the Act, which relief can include, but is not limited to, an order of immediate cessation. Pp. 311-320.
(a) The grant of jurisdiction to a court to ensure compliance with a statute does not suggest an absolute duty to grant injunctive relief under any and all circumstances, and a federal judge sitting as chancellor is not mechanically obligated to grant an injunction for every violation of law. Pp. 311-313.
(b) Here, an injunction is not the only means of ensuring compliance, TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, distinguished, since the FWPCA provides, for example, for fines and criminal penalties.  While the FWPCA's purpose in preserving the integrity of the Nation's waters is to be achieved by compliance with the Act, including compliance with the permit requirements, in this case the discharge of the ordnance has not polluted the waters, and, although the District Court [****3]  refused to enjoin the discharge, it neither ignored the statutory violation nor undercut the purpose and function of the permit system.  The FWPCA's prohibition against discharge of pollutants can be overcome by the very permit the Navy was ordered to seek.  Pp. 313-316.
(c) The statutory scheme as a whole contemplates the exercise of discretion and balancing of equities, and suggests that Congress did not intend to deny courts the discretion to rely on remedies other than an immediate prohibitory injunction. Pp. 316-318.
(d) The provision of the FWPCA permitting the President to exempt federal facilities from compliance with the permit requirements does not indicate congressional intent to limit the court's discretion.  The Act permits the exercise of a court's equitable discretion, whether the source of pollution is a private party or a federal agency, to order relief that will achieve compliance with the Act, whereas the exemption permits noncompliance by federal agencies in extraordinary circumstances.  Pp. 318-319.
(e) Nor does the legislative history suggest that Congress intended to deny courts their traditional equitable discretion.  P. 319.

Opinion




 [*306]  [***95]  [**1800]    JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court. 
 LEdHN[1A][] [1A]The issue in this case is whether the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA or Act), 86 Stat. 816, as amended, 33 U. S. C. § 1251 et seq. (1976 ed. and Supp. IV), requires a district court to enjoin immediately all discharges of pollutants  [*307]  that do not comply with the Act's permit requirements or whether the district court retains discretion to order other relief to achieve compliance.  The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that [****5]  the Act withdrew the courts' equitable discretion.  Romero-Barcelo v. Brown, 643 F.2d 835 (1981). We reverse.
I
For many years, the Navy has used Vieques Island, a small island off the Puerto Rico coast, for weapons training. Currently all Atlantic Fleet vessels assigned to the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean are required to complete their training at Vieques because it permits a full range of exercises under conditions similar to combat.  During air-to-ground training, however, pilots sometimes miss land-based targets, and ordnance falls into the sea.  That is, accidental bombings of the navigable waters and, occasionally, intentional bombings of water targets occur.  The District  [**1801]  Court found that these discharges have not harmed the quality of the water.
In 1978, respondents, who include the Governor of Puerto Rico and  [***96]  residents of the island, sued to enjoin the Navy's operations on the island. Their complaint alleged violations of numerous federal environmental statutes and various other Acts. 1  [****7]  After an extensive hearing, the District Court found  [*308]  that under the explicit terms of the Act, the Navy had violated the [****6]  Act by discharging ordnance into the waters surrounding the island without first obtaining a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 2  Romero-Barcelo v. Brown, 478 F.Supp. 646 (PR 1979).
HN1[] Under the FWPCA, the "discharge of any pollutant" requires a National Pollutant [****8]  Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.  33 U. S. C. §§ 1311(a), 1323(a) (1976 ed. and Supp. IV).  The term "discharge of any pollutant" is defined as
"any addition of any pollutant to the waters of the contiguous zone or the ocean from any point source other than a vessel or other floating craft." 33 U. S. C. § 1362(12) (emphasis added).
Pollutant, in turn, means
"dredged spoil, solid waste, incinerator residue, sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, chemical wastes, biological materials, radioactive materials, heat, wrecked  [*309]  or discarded equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt and industrial, municipal, and agricultural waste discharged into water. . . ." 33 U. S. C. § 1362(6) (emphasis added).
And, HN2[] under the Act, a "point source" is
"any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, or vessel or other floating craft from which pollutants are or may be discharged. . . ." 33 U. S. C. § 1362(14)  [***97]  (1976 ed., Supp. IV) (emphasis added).
HN3[] Under the FWPCA, the EPA may [****9]  not issue an NPDES permit without state certification that the permit conforms to state water quality standards.  A State has the authority to deny certification of the permit application or attach conditions to the final permit.  33 U. S. C. § 1341.
As the District Court construed the FWPCA, the release of ordnance from aircraft or from ships into navigable waters is a discharge of pollutants, even though the EPA, which administers the Act, had not promulgated any regulations setting effluent levels or providing for the issuance of an NPDES permit for this category of  [**1802]  pollutants. 3  [****11]  Recognizing that violations of the Act "must be cured," 478 F.Supp., at 707, the District Court ordered the Navy to apply for an NPDES permit.  It refused, however, to enjoin Navy operations pending  [*310]  consideration of the permit application.  It explained that the Navy's "technical violations" were not causing any "appreciable harm" to the environment. 4  Id., at 706. Moreover, because of the importance of the island as a training center, "the granting of the injunctive relief sought would cause grievous, and perhaps irreparable harm, not only to [****10]  Defendant Navy, but to the general welfare of this Nation." 5  Id., at 707. The District Court concluded that an injunction was not necessary to ensure suitably prompt compliance by the Navy.  To support this conclusion, it emphasized an equity court's traditionally broad discretion in deciding appropriate relief and quoted from the classic description of injunctive relief in Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329-330 (1944): "The historic injunctive process was designed to deter, not to punish."
The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit vacated the District Court's order and remanded with instructions that the court order [****12]  the Navy to cease the violation until it obtained a permit.  643 F.2d 835 (1981). Relying on TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (1978), in which this Court held that an imminent violation of the Endangered Species Act required injunctive relief, the Court of Appeals concluded  [***98]  that the District Court  [*311]  erred in undertaking a traditional balancing of the parties' competing interests.  "Whether or not the Navy's activities in fact harm the coastal waters, it has an absolute statutory obligation to stop any discharges of pollutants until the permit procedure has been followed and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, upon review of the evidence, has granted a permit." 643 F.2d, at 861. The court suggested that if the order would interfere significantly with military preparedness, the Navy should request that the President grant it an exemption from the requirements in the interest of national security." 6 
 [****13]   [**1803]  Because this case posed an important question regarding the power of the federal courts to grant or withhold equitable relief for violations of the FWPCA, we granted certiorari, 454 U.S. 813 (1981). We now reverse.

 LEdHN[1B][] [1B]LEdHN[2][] [2]It goes without saying that HN5[] an injunction is an equitable remedy.  It "is not a remedy which issues as of course," Harrisonville v. W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co., 289 U.S. 334, 337-338 (1933), or "to restrain an act the injurious consequences of which are merely trifling." Consolidated Canal Co.  [*312]  v. Mesa Canal Co., 177 U.S. 296, 302 (1900).An injunction should issue only where the intervention of a court of equity "is essential in order effectually to protect property rights against injuries otherwise irremediable." Cavanaugh v. Looney, 248 U.S. 453, 456 (1919). The Court has repeatedly held that the basis for injunctive relief in the federal courts has always been irreparable injury and the inadequacy of legal remedies.  Rondeau v. Mosinee Paper Corp., 422 U.S. 49, 61 (1975); Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 88 (1974);  [****14]  Beacon Theaters, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 506-507 (1959); Hecht Co. v. Bowles, supra, at 329.
HN6[] Where plaintiff and defendant present competing claims of injury, the traditional function of equity has been to arrive at a "nice adjustment and reconciliation" between the competing claims, Hecht Co. v. Bowles, supra, at 329. In such cases, the court "balances the conveniences of the parties and possible injuries to them according as they may be affected by the granting or withholding of the injunction." Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 440  [***99]  (1944). "The essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power of the Chancellor to do equity and to mould each decree to the necessities of the particular case.  Flexibility rather than rigidity has distinguished it." Hecht Co. v. Bowles, supra, at 329. 

 LEdHN[3][] [3]In exercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should pay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction. Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 500 (1941). Thus, the [****15]  Court has noted that HN7[] "[the] award of an interlocutory injunction by courts of equity has never been regarded as strictly a matter of right, even though irreparable injury may otherwise result to the plaintiff," and that "where an injunction is asked which will adversely affect a public interest for whose impairment, even temporarily, an injunction bond cannot compensate, the court may in the public interest withhold relief until a final determination of the rights of the parties, though the postponement may be burdensome to the  [*313]  plaintiff." Yakus v. United States, supra, at 440 (footnote omitted).  The grant of jurisdiction to ensure compliance with a statute hardly suggests an absolute duty to do so under any and all circumstances, and a federal judge sitting as chancellor is not mechanically obligated to grant an injunction for every violation of law. TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S., at 193; Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S., at 329. 
 LEdHN[4][] [4]These commonplace considerations applicable to cases in which injunctions are sought in the federal courts reflect a "practice with a background of several hundred years of history,"  [****16] Hecht Co. v. Bowles, supra, at 329, a practice of which Congress is assuredly well aware.  Of course, Congress may intervene and guide or control the exercise of the courts' discretion, but we do not lightly assume that Congress has intended to depart from established principles.  Hecht Co. v. Bowles, supra, at 329. As the Court said in Porter v. Warner  [**1804]  Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398 (1946):
"Moreover, HN8[] the comprehensiveness of this equitable jurisdiction is not to be denied or limited in the absence of a clear and valid legislative command.  Unless a statute in so many words, or by a necessary and inescapable inference, restricts the court's jurisdiction in equity, the full scope of that jurisdiction is to be recognized and applied.  'The great principles of equity, securing complete justice, should not be yielded to light inferences, or doubtful construction.' Brown v. Swann, 10 Pet. 497, 503 . . . ."
In TVA v. Hill, we held that Congress had foreclosed the exercise of the usual discretion possessed by a court of equity.  There, we thought that "[one] would be [****17]  hard pressed to find a statutory provision whose terms were any plainer" than that before us.  437 U.S., at 173. The statute involved, the Endangered Species Act, 87 Stat. 884, 16 U. S. C. § 1531 et seq., required the District Court to enjoin completion of the Tellico Dam in order to preserve the snail  [*314]  darter, a species  [***100]  of perch.  The purpose and language of the statute under consideration in Hill, not the bare fact of a statutory violation, compelled that conclusion.  Section 7 of the Act, 16 U. S. C. § 1536, requires federal agencies to "insure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of [any] endangered species . . . or result in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species which is determined . . . to be critical." The statute thus contains a flat ban on the destruction of critical habitats.
It was conceded in Hill that completion of the dam would eliminate an endangered species by destroying its critical habitat.  Refusal to enjoin the action would have ignored the "explicit provisions of the Endangered Species Act." 437 U.S., at 173. Congress,  [****18]  it appeared to us, had chosen the snail darter over the dam.  The purpose and language of the statute limited the remedies available to the District Court; only an injunction could vindicate the objectives of the Act.
That is not the case here.  An injunction is not the only means of ensuring compliance.  The FWPCA itself, for example, provides for fines and criminal penalties.  33 U. S. C. §§ 1319(c) and (d).  Respondents suggest that failure to enjoin the Navy will undermine the integrity of the permit process by allowing the statutory violation to continue.  The integrity of the Nation's waters, however, not the permit process, is the purpose of the FWPCA. 7  As Congress explained, the objective of the FWPCA is to "restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters." 33 U. S. C. § 1251(a).
 [****19]  [*315]   This purpose is to be achieved by compliance with the Act, including compliance with the permit requirements. 8  Here, however, the discharge of ordnance had not polluted the waters, and, although the District Court declined to enjoin the discharges, it neither ignored the statutory violation nor undercut the purpose and function of the permit system.  The court ordered the Navy to apply for a permit. 9  It temporarily,  [**1805]  not permanently, allowed the Navy  [***101]  to continue its activities without a permit.
 [****20]  In Hill, we also noted that none of the limited "hardship exemptions" of the Endangered Species Act would "even remotely apply to the Tellico Project." 437 U.S., at 188. The prohibition of the FWPCA against discharge of pollutants, in contrast, can be overcome by the very permit the Navy was ordered to seek. 10  The Senate Report to the 1972  [*316]  Amendments explains that the permit program would be enacted because "the Committee recognizes the impracticality of any effort to halt all pollution immediately." S. Rep. No. 92-414, p. 43 (1971).  That the scheme as a whole contemplates the exercise of discretion and balancing of equities militates against the conclusion that Congress intended to deny courts their traditional equitable discretion in enforcing the statute.
 [****21]   LEdHN[5A][] [5A]Other aspects of the statutory scheme also suggest that Congress did not intend to deny courts the discretion to rely on remedies other than an immediate prohibitory injunction. Although the ultimate objective of the FWPCA is to eliminate all discharges of pollutants into the navigable waters by 1985, the statute sets forth a scheme of phased compliance.  HN10[] As enacted, it called for the achievement of the "best practicable control technology currently available" by July 1, 1977, and the "best available technology economically achievable" by July 1, 1983.  33 U. S. C. § 1311(b).  This scheme of phased compliance further suggests that this is a statute in which Congress envisioned, rather than curtailed, the exercise of discretion. 11  
 LEdHN[5B][] [5B]
 [****22]  HN11[]  
 [*317]  The FWPCA directs the Administrator of the EPA to seek an injunction to restrain immediately discharges  [***102]  of pollutants he finds to be presenting "an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons or to the welfare of persons." 33 U. S. C. § 1364(a) (1976 ed., Supp. IV).  This rule of immediate cessation, however, is limited to the indicated class of violations.  For other kinds of violations, the FWPCA  [**1806]  authorizes the Administrator of the EPA "to commence a civil action for appropriate relief, including a permanent or temporary injunction, for any violation for which he is authorized to issue a compliance order . . . ." 33 U. S. C. § 1319(b). 12  The provision makes clear that Congress did not  [*318]  anticipate that all discharges would be immediately enjoined.  Consistent with this view, the administrative practice has not been to request immediate cessation orders.  "Rather, enforcement actions typically result, by consent or otherwise, in a remedial order setting out a detailed schedule of compliance designed to cure the identified violation of the Act." Brief for Petitioners 17.  See Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 320-322 (1981).  [****23]  Here, again, the statutory scheme contemplates equitable consideration.
 [****24]   LEdHN[6][] [6]Both the Court of Appeals and respondents attach particular weight to the provision of the FWPCA permitting the President to exempt federal facilities from compliance with the permit requirements.  33 U. S. C. § 1323(a) (1976 ed., Supp. IV). 13  They suggest that this provision indicates congressional intent to limit the court's discretion.  According to respondents, the exemption provision evidences Congress' determination that only paramount national interests justify failure to comply and that only the President should make this judgment.
We do not construe the provision so broadly.  We read the FWPCA as permitting the exercise of a court's equitable discretion, whether the source of pollution is a private party or a federal agency, to order relief that will achieve compliance with the Act.  The exemption serves a different and complementary purpose, that of permitting noncompliance by federal agencies in extraordinary circumstances.  Executive Order No. 12088, 3 CFR 243 (1979),  [****25]  which implements the exemption authority, requires the federal agency requesting such an exemption  [***103]  to certify that it cannot meet the applicable pollution standards.  "Exemptions are granted by the President only if the conflict between pollution control standards and crucial federal activities cannot be resolved through the development of a practicable remedial program." Brief for Petitioners 26, n. 30.
 [*319]  Should the Navy receive a permit here, there would be no need to invoke the machinery of the Presidential exemption. If not, this course remains open.  The exemption provision would enable the President, believing paramount national interests so require, to authorize discharges which the District Court has enjoined.  Reading the statute to permit the exercise of a court's equitable discretion in no way eliminates the role of the exemption provision in the statutory scheme.
Like the language and structure of the Act, the legislative history does not suggest that Congress intended to deny courts their traditional equitable discretion.  Congress  [**1807]  passed the 1972 Amendments because it recognized that "the national effort to abate and control water pollution [****26]  has been inadequate in every vital aspect." S. Rep. No. 92-414, p. 7 (1971).  The past failings included enforcement efforts under the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 (Refuse Act), 33 U. S. C. § 401 et seq.  The "major purpose" of the 1972 Amendments was "to establish a comprehensive long-range policy for the elimination of water pollution." S. Rep. No. 92-414, supra, at 95.  The permit system was the key to that policy.  "The Amendments established a new system of regulation under which it is illegal for anyone to discharge pollutants into the Nation's waters except pursuant to a permit." Milwaukee v. Illinois, supra, at 310-311; see generally EPA v. California ex rel. State Water Resources Control Board, 426 U.S. 200 (1976). Nonetheless, "[in] writing the enforcement procedures involving the Federal Government the Committee drew extensively . . . upon the existing enforcement provisions of the Refuse Act of 1899." S. Rep. No. 92-414, supra, at 63.  Violations of the Refuse Act have not automatically led courts to issue injunctions. See Reserve Mining Co. v. EPA, 514 F.2d 492, 535-538 (CA8 1975);  [****27]  United States v. Rohm & Haas Co., 500 F.2d 167, 175 (CA5 1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 962 (1975); United States v. Kennebec Log Driving Co., 491 F.2d 562, 571 (CA1 1973), on remand, 399 F.Supp. 754, 759-760 (Me. 1975).
 [*320]  III

 LEdHN[1C][] [1C]This Court explained in Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321 (1944), that a major departure from the long tradition of equity practice should not be lightly implied.  As we did there, we construe the statute at issue "in favor of that interpretation which affords a full opportunity for equity courts to treat enforcement proceedings . . . in accordance with their traditional practices, as conditioned by the necessities of the public interest which Congress has sought to protect." Id., at 330.We do not read the FWPCA as foreclosing completely the exercise of the court's discretion.  HN12[] Rather than requiring a district court to issue an injunction for any and all statutory violations, the  [***104]  FWPCA permits the district court to order that relief it considers necessary to secure prompt compliance with the Act.  That relief can include,  [****28]  but is not limited to, an order of immediate cessation.
The exercise of equitable discretion, which must include the ability to deny as well as grant injunctive relief, can fully protect the range of public interests at issue at this stage in the proceedings.  The District Court did not face a situation in which a permit would very likely not issue, and the requirements and objective of the statute could therefore not be vindicated if discharges were permitted to continue.  Should it become clear that no permit will be issued and that compliance with the FWPCA will not be forthcoming, the statutory scheme and purpose would require the court to reconsider the balance it has struck. 
 LEdHN[7][] [7]Because Congress, in enacting the FWPCA, has not foreclosed the exercise of equitable discretion, the proper standard for appellate review is whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying an immediate cessation order while the Navy applied for a permit.  We reverse and remand to the Court of Appeals for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

 [*321]  JUSTICE POWELL, concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court.  In my view, however, the record clearly establishes [****29]  that the District Court in this case did not abuse its discretion by refusing to enjoin the immediate cessation of all discharges.  Finding that the District Court acted well within the equitable discretion left to it under the Federal Water Pollution Control  [**1808]  Act (FWPCA), I would remand the case to the Court of Appeals with instructions that the decision of the District Court should be affirmed. * 
 [****30]  The propriety of this disposition is emphasized by the dissenting opinion of JUSTICE STEVENS, post, p. 322.  I agree with his view that Congress may limit a court's equitable discretion in granting remedies under a particular statute, and that some statutes may constrain discretion more narrowly than others.  I stand with the Court, however, in finding no indication that Congress intended to limit the court's equitable discretion under the FWPCA in the manner suggested by JUSTICE STEVENS.  As the Court's remand order might be thought to leave open whether the District Court in this case acted  [***105]  within its range of permissible discretion under the  [*322]  FWPCA, it would promote both clarity and economy for us to hold now that the District Court did not abuse its discretion and that its decision should be reinstated.

JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
The appropriate remedy for the violation of a federal statute depends primarily on the terms of the statute and the character of the violation.  Unless Congress specifically commands a particular form of relief, the question of remedy remains subject to a court's equitable discretion. 1  Because the Federal Water Pollution [****31]  Control Act does not specifically command the federal courts to issue an injunction every time an unpermitted discharge of a pollutant occurs, the Court today is obviously correct in asserting that such injunctions should not issue "automatically" or "mechanically" in every case.  It is nevertheless equally clear that by enacting the 1972 Amendments to the FWPCA Congress channeled the discretion of the federal judiciary much more narrowly than the Court's rather glib opinion suggests.  Indeed, although there may well be situations in which the failure to obtain an NPDES permit would not require immediate cessation of all discharges, I am convinced that Congress has circumscribed the district courts' discretion on the question of remedy so narrowly that a general rule of immediate cessation must be applied in all but a narrow category of cases.  The Court of Appeals was quite correct in holding that this case does not present the kind of exceptional situation that justifies a departure from the general rule.
 [****32]  The Court's mischaracterization of the Court of Appeals' holding is the premise for its essay on equitable discretion.  This essay is analytically flawed because it overlooks the limitations on equitable discretion that apply in cases in which public interests are implicated and the defendant's violation  [*323]  of the law is ongoing.  Of greater importance, the Court's opinion grants an open-ended license to federal judges to carve gaping holes in a reticulated statutory scheme designed by Congress to protect a precious natural resource from the consequences of ad hoc judgments about specific discharges of pollutants.
I
Contrary to the impression created by the Court's opinion, the Court of Appeals  [**1809]  did not hold that the District Court was under an absolute duty to require compliance with the FWPCA "under any and all circumstances," ante, at 313, or that it was "mechanically obligated to grant an injunction for every violation of law," ibid.  The only "absolute duty" that the Court of Appeals mentioned was the Navy's duty to obtain a permit before discharging pollutants into the waters off Vieques Island. 2  In light of  [***106]  the Court's opinion the point [****33]  is worth repeating -- the Navy, like anyone else, 3  must obey the law.
 [****34]   [*324]  The Court of Appeals did not hold that the District Court had no discretion in formulating remedies for statutory violations.  It merely "[concluded] that the district court erred in undertaking a traditional balancing of the parties' competing interests." Romero-Barcelo v. Brown, 643 F.2d 835, 861 (CA1 1981). The District Court was not free to disregard the "congressional ordering of priorities" and "the judiciary's 'responsibility to protect the integrity of the . . . process mandated by Congress.'" Ibid. (quoting Jones v. Lynn, 477 F.2d 885, 892 (CA1 1973)). The Court of Appeals distinguished a statutory violation that could be deemed merely "technical" from the Navy's "[utter disregard of] the statutory mandate." 643 F.2d, at 861-862. It then pointed out that an order prohibiting any discharge of ordnance into the coastal waters off Vieques until an NPDES permit was obtained would not significantly affect the Navy's training operations because most, if not all, of the Navy's targets were land-based.  Id., at 862, n. 55. Finally, it noted that the statute authorized the Navy  [****35]  to obtain an exemption from the President if an injunction would have a significant effect on national security. Id., at 862; see 33 U. S. C. § 1323(a) (1976 ed., Supp. IV).
Under these circumstances -- the statutory violation is blatant and not merely technical, and the Navy's predicament was foreseen and accommodated by Congress -- the Court of Appeals essentially held that the District Court retained no discretion to deny an injunction. The discretion exercised by the District Court in this case was wholly at odds with the intent of Congress in enacting the FWPCA.  In essence, the District Court's remedy was a judicial permit exempting the Navy's operations in Vieques from the statute until such time as it could obtain a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency or a statutory exemption from the President.  The two principal bases for the temporary judicial permit were matters that Congress did not commit to judicial discretion.  First, the District Court was persuaded that the pollution  [*325]  was not harming the quality of the coastal waters, see Romero-Barcelo v. Brown, 478 F.Supp. 646, 706-707 (PR 1979); and second, the [****36]  court was concerned that compliance with the Act might adversely affect national security, see id., at 707-708. The Court of Appeals correctly noted that the first consideration is the  [**1810]  business of the EPA 4   [***107]  and the second is the business of the President. 5 
 [****37]  The Court unfairly uses the Court of Appeals' opinion in this case as a springboard for a lecture on the principles of equitable remedies.  The Court of Appeals' reasoning was correct in all respects.  It recognized that the statute categorically prohibits discharges of pollutants without a permit.  Unlike the Court, see ante, at 314-315, it recognized that the requested injunction was the only remedy that would bring the Navy into compliance with the statute on Congress' timetable. 6  [****38]  It then demonstrated that none of the reasons offered  [*326]  by the District Court for refusing injunctive relief was consistent with the statute or was compelling under the circumstances.  The position of the Court of Appeals in effect was that the federal courts' equitable discretion is constrained by a strong presumption in favor of enforcing the law as Congress has written it.  By reversing, the Court casts doubt on the validity of that position.  This doubt is especially dangerous in the environmental area, where the temptations to delay compliance are already substantial. 7 
II
Our cases concerning equitable remedies have repeatedly identified two critical distinctions that the Court simply ignores today.  The first is the distinction between cases in which only private interests are involved and those in which a requested injunction will implicate a public interest. Second, within the category of public interest cases, those cases in which there is no danger that a past violation of law will recur have always been treated differently [****39]  from those in which an  [***108]  existing violation is certain to continue.
 Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, illustrates the first distinction.  The Court there held that Congress constitutionally could preclude a private party from obtaining an injunction against enforcement of federal price control regulations pending an adjudication of their validity.  In any balancing process, the Court explained, special deference must be given to the public interest:
 [*327]  "Even in suits in which only private interests are involved the award is a matter  [**1811]  of sound judicial discretion, in the exercise of which the court balances the conveniences of the parties and possible injuries to them according as they may be affected by the granting or withholding of the injunction. . . .
"But where an injunction is asked which will adversely affect a public interest for whose impairment, even temporarily, an injunction bond cannot compensate, the court may in the public interest withhold relief until a final determination of the rights of the parties, though the postponement may be burdensome to the plaintiff." Id., at 440 (footnote omitted).

 [****40]  In that case, the public interest, reflected in an Act of Congress, was in opposition to the availability of injunctive relief. The Court stated, however, that the public interest factor would have the same special weight if it favored the granting of an injunction:


"This is but another application of the principle, declared in Virginia Ry. Co. v. System Federation, 300 U.S. 515, 552, that 'Courts of equity may, and frequently do, go much farther both to give and withhold relief in furtherance of the public interest than they are accustomed to go when only private interests are involved.'" Id., at 441.
Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, which the Court repeatedly cites, did involve an attempt to obtain an injunction against future violations of a federal statute.  That case fell into the category of cases in which a past violation of law had been found and the question was whether an injunction should issue to prevent future violations.  Cf.  United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633-636; United States v. Oregon Medical Society, 343 U.S. 326, 332-334. Because the record [****41]  established that the past violations were inadvertent,  [*328]  that they had been promptly terminated, and that the defendant had taken vigorous and adequate steps to prevent any recurrence, the Court held that the District Court had discretion to deny injunctive relief. But in reaching that conclusion, the Court made it clear that judicial discretion "must be exercised in light of the large objectives of the Act.  For the standards of the public interest, not the requirements of private litigation, measure the propriety and need for injunctive relief in these cases." 321 U.S., at 331. Indeed, the Court emphasized that any exercise of discretion "should reflect an acute awareness of the Congressional admonition" in the statute at issue.  Ibid.
 [***109]  In contrast to the decision in Hecht, today the Court pays mere lipservice to the statutory mandate and attaches no weight to the fact that the Navy's violation of law has not been corrected. 8  The Court cites no precedent for its holding that an ongoing deliberate violation of a federal statute should be treated like any garden-variety private nuisance action in which the chancellor has the widest discretion [****42]  in fashioning relief. 9 
Our prior cases involving the appropriate remedy for an ongoing violation of federal law establish a much more stringent test than the Court applies today.  Thus, in United States v. City and County of San Francisco, 310 U.S. 16, a case in which the Government claimed that the city's disposition of electric power was prohibited by an Act of Congress, the Court held that "this case does not call for a balancing of equities or for the invocation of the generalities of judicial maxims in order to determine whether an injunction should have issued." Id., at 30. "The equitable doctrines relied on do not militate against the capacity of a court of equity as a  [*329]  proper  [**1812]  forum in which to make a declared policy of Congress effective."  [****43]  Id., at 31. An injunction to prohibit continued violation of that policy "is both appropriate and necessary." Ibid. 10 
In Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, the Court plainly stated that an equitable remedy for the violation of a federal statute was neither automatic on the one hand, nor [****44]  simply a matter of balancing the equities on the other. 11   [***110]  Albemarle holds that the district court's remedial  [*330]  decision must be measured against the purposes that inform the Act of Congress that has been violated.  Id., at 417.
 [****45]  III
The Court's discussion of the FWPCA creates the impression that Congress did not intend any significant change in the enforcement provisions of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899.  See ante, at 319.  The Court goes so far as to suggest that the FWPCA is little more than a codification of the common law of nuisance. 12  The contrast between this casual attitude toward the FWPCA and the Court's writing in Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, is stark.  In that case the Court refused to allow federal judges to supplement the statutory enforcement scheme by enjoining  [**1813]  a nuisance, whereas in this case the question is whether a federal judge may create a loophole in the scheme by refusing  [*331]  to enjoin a violation.  Why a different standard should be used to define the scope of judicial discretion in these two situations is not explained.
 [****46]  In Milwaukee v. Illinois the Court described the FWPCA in these terms:
"The statutory scheme established by Congress provides a forum for the pursuit of such claims before expert agencies by means of the permit-granting process.  It would be quite inconsistent with this scheme if federal courts were in effect to 'write their own ticket' under the guise of federal common law after permits have already been issued and permittees have been planning and operating in reliance on them." Id., at 326.
Ironically, today the Court holds that federal district courts may in effect "write their own ticket" under the guise of federal common law before permits have been issued.
The Court distinguishes TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, on the ground that the Endangered Species Act contained a "flat ban" on the destruction of critical  [***111]  habitats.  Ante, at 314.  But the statute involved in this case also contains a flat ban against discharges of pollutants into coastal waters without a permit. 13  [****48]  Surely the congressional directive to protect the  [*332]  Nation's waters from gradual but possibly irreversible contamination is no less clear than  [****47]  the command to protect the snail darter. 14  To assume that Congress has placed a greater value on the protection of vanishing forms of animal life than on the protection of our water resources is to ignore the text, the legislative history, 15  and the previously consistent interpretation of this statute. 16 
 [****49]  It is true that in TVA v. Hill there was no room for compromise between the federal  [**1814]  project and the statutory objective to preserve an endangered species; either the snail  [*333]  darter or the completion of the Tellico Dam had to be sacrificed.  In the FWPCA, the Court tells us, the congressional objective is to protect the integrity of the Nation's waters, not to protect the integrity of the permit process.  Ante, at 314.  Therefore, the Court continues, ante, at 315, a federal court may compromise the process chosen by Congress to protect our waters as long as the court is content that the waters are not  [***112]  actually being harmed by the particular discharge of pollutants.
On analysis, however, this reasoning does not distinguish the two cases.  Courts are in no better position to decide whether the permit process is necessary to achieve the objectives of the FWPCA than they are to decide whether the destruction of the snail darter is an acceptable cost of completing the Tellico Dam.  Congress has made both decisions, and there is nothing in the respective statutes or legislative histories to suggest that Congress invited the federal courts to [****50]  second-guess the former decision any more than the latter.
A disregard of the respective roles of the three branches of government also tarnishes the Court's other principal argument in favor of expansive equitable discretion in this area. 17  The Court points out that Congress intended to halt water pollution gradually, not immediately, and that "the scheme as a whole contemplates the exercise of discretion and balancing of equities." Ante, at 316.  In the Court's words, Congress enacted a "scheme of phased compliance." Ibid.  Equitable discretion in enforcing the statute, the Court states, is therefore consistent with the statutory scheme.
The Court's sophistry is premised on a gross misunderstanding of the statutory scheme. Naturally, in 1972 Congress did not expect dischargers to end pollution immediately. 18  [****52]  Rather, it entrusted to expert administrative  [*334]  agencies the task of establishing timetables by which dischargers could reach that ultimate goal.  These timetables [****51]  are determined by the agencies and included in the NPDES permits; the conditions in the permits constitute the terms by which compliance with the statute is measured. 19  Quite obviously, then, the requirement that each discharger subject itself to the permit process is crucial to the operation of the "scheme of phased compliance." By requiring each discharger to obtain a permit before continuing its discharges of pollutants, Congress demonstrated an intolerance for delay in compliance with the statute.  It is also obvious that the "exercise of discretion and balancing of equities" were tasks delegated  [***113]  by Congress to expert agencies, not to federal courts, yet the Court simply ignores the difference.
IV
The decision in TVA v. Hill did not depend on any peculiar or unique statutory  [**1815]  language.  Nor did it rest on any special interest in snail darters. The decision reflected a profound  [*335]  respect for the law and the proper allocation of lawmaking [****53]  responsibilities in our Government. 20  There we refused to sit as a committee of review.  Today the Court authorizes freethinking federal judges to do just that.  Instead of requiring adherence to carefully integrated statutory procedures that assign to nonjudicial decisionmakers the responsibilities for evaluating potential harm to our water supply as well as potential harm to our national security, the Court unnecessarily and casually substitutes the chancellor's clumsy foot for the rule of law.
 [****54]  I respectfully dissent.
