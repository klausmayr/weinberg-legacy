## Info about R Script

I'm sharing the R script I used to scrape, analyze, and geocode the data used in this Leaflet map. It's not especially organized and isn't just a plug and play sort of thing. Hopefully it can still help set you on the right path to making use of LexisNexis court briefs.

I downloaded all of the files from LexisNexis as .docx files and then converted them to .txt files in R. Below is an example of the text file and the resulting dataframe that I got after running the R script.
